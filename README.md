Carnage
===

### About

`Carnage` is a Quake 3 clone done with HTML5 and Canvas (at a really really early state). This repository represents the game client, a game server will be created as soon as the engine etc. works fine.

### Aims

* Create a 3rd person top-down view clone of Quake 3
* Multiplayer functionality with dedicated servers (done with node.js)
* Easy level creation using simple bmp / png graphics

### License

None, yetâ€¦
